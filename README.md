# to install the latest version:
'modEvA' was created long before I knew GitHub, and it's still maintained on its original platform, [R-Forge](https://modeva.r-forge.r-project.org/). So, you can install the development version with:

`install.packages("modEvA", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")`

The package is also on CRAN, but the development version (above) often includes recent enhancements and small bug fixes.

Feedback welcome!
